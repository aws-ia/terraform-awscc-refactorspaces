# Example: Deploying and configuring AWS Refactor Spaces in a single account

The following example deploys AWS Refactor Spaces components within a single AWS account including the environment, application, and all service routes. We recommend only using this for proof-of-concept or testing purposes. In production, deploy microservices in separate AWS accounts to simplify implementation of least-privilege access models for a single application scope, simplify internal resource tracking and chargeback, and service limits and quotas.

Figure 1. Example configuration of AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces deployed with a monolithic application Unishop with a new AddToCart microservice, running as an AWS Lambda microservice.

As shown in the diagram, the solution in this example sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* In one virtual private cloud (VPC):
  * Private subnets containing an AWS Transit Gateway attachment. Amazon API Gateway uses this attachment to communicate with workloads deployed in other AWS accounts/VPCs.*
  * A Network Load Balancer, which uses the VPC link feature and distributes incoming traffic.*
* In the second VPC:
  * Private subnets, which contain an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that hosts the monolithic Unistore legacy application. Each subnet also contains an AWS Transit Gateway attachment, which is used to provide private connectivity between the API Gateway and the application hosted within the VPC.*
  * An Application Load Balancer to forward traffic to the Amazon EC2 instances.*
* In the AWS Migration Hub's Refactor Spaces environment:
  * AWS Transit Gateway, provisioned and managed by AWS Migration Hub's Refactor Spaces. If you choose to bring your own AWS Transit Gateway, this can be controlled using an optional input parameter.
  * A Refactor Spaces application that manages Amazon API Gateway and two services: Default and AddtoCart. Default acts as the default route for traffic to the Unistore application. AddtoCart sends AddtoCart domain requests to the AWS Lambda function.
* A Lambda function that holds the modernized AddToCart business logic strangled from the Unistore application.

*The Terraform module that deploys this solution does not include the components marked by asterisks. These components, which you would provide as inputs, are depicted to illustrate a real-world deployment scenario.
